<h3>How it works:</h3>
<span class="byline">Life Coaching is a goal-based process designed to help and guide you towards improving the quality of your life.
As your Life Coach, my focus is not on the past, but on your development and self-improvement right now and into your future.</span>
<span class="byline">Throughout your sessions, you'll receive guidance, insights, encouragement, structure 
and support to achieve your goal or goals.</span>
<span class="byline">The work we do in the course of your coaching sessions, will benefit you for the rest of your life.
Your communication skills, your ability to prioritize, your sense of self worth, your appreciation of others, 
your increased ability to feel positive and vital... These are just some of the permanent, profound changes.</span>
</header>
</div>
<div class="6u">
<h4>We start with a free consultation.</h4>
<p>Your Life Coaching process begins with a free 15 minute phone consultation to determine that coaching is 
the right fit for you, and to determine that we both feel we're the right fit for each other.
At the end of your consultation, we schedule your one-time Discovery Session.</p> 
<p>This session is 45-60 minutes, for an in-depth assessment of your goals, your needs and the best Coaching package for you.</p>
<p>Coaching is an incredibly rewarding course of action. As with anything of value, it involves
dedicated time and effort. To make sure that you truly benefit, a minimum two month commitment is required.
(For more details, see the <a href="investment">investment</a> page.)</p>

<h5>Some things to know:</h5>
</header>
<p>Sessions are 30-45 minutes each and are conducted by phone, based on a schedule we arrange and confirm in advance.
Our phone-sessions allow for a convenient series of appointments
that fit comfortably into your monthly or weekly agenda.</p>
<p>You can choose a different goal per session, or just one to focus on over time. Whichever you feel is the most beneficial to you. 
This is also something weâ€™ll assess during your Discovery Session.</p>
<p>Please be aware that Life Coaches are not clinical therapists or psychological counsellors. 
If you are seeking help for serious mental or emotional issues, you can find a 
list of therapists and counsellors in your area by clicking <a href="https://www.cpca-rpc.ca/counsellor-directory.aspx" class="button alt">here</a>.</p>

<h6>Some things to expect during the coaching process:</h6>
</header>
<p class="medium">You'll fill out a one-time self-assessment form after your Discovery Session.
You'll be emailed information in advance and you'll take some notes during each session.
You'll openly and honestly answer questions designed to give you clarity and focus. 
We'll work together through mental and verbal exercises related to your goals.
Each session includes a specific 'homework' assignment designed to improve your life skills.
Each session ends with a personalized goal to help you take consistent action in moving forward.
You're expected to be proactive and accountable in all areas pertaining to your Coaching commitment.</p>
