<h3>How it works:</h3>
<p>Life Coaching is a goal-based process designed to help and guide you towards improving the quality of your life.
As your Life Coach, my focus is not on the past, but on your development and self-improvement right now and into your future.
Throughout your sessions, you'll receive guidance, insights, encouragement, structure 
and support to achieve your goal or goals.</p>
<p>Your Life Coaching process begins with a free 15 minute phone consultation to clarify that coaching is 
appropriate for your needs and to determine that we both feel we're the right fit for each other.
At the end of your consultation, we schedule your one-time Discovery Session. 
This session is 45-60 minutes, for an in-depth assessment of your goals, your needs and the best Coaching package for you.</p>
<p>Coaching is an incredibly rewarding course of action. As with anything of value, it does require
dedicated time and effort. A minimum two month commitment is necessary. 
(For more details, see the <a href="investment">investment</a> page.)</p>
<p>Sessions are 30-45 minutes each and are conducted by phone, based on a schedule we arrange and confirm in advance.
Our phone-sessions allow for a convenient series of appointments
that fit comfortably into your monthly or weekly agenda.</p>
<p>You may be looking to improve the quality of one specific area of your life, such as career or relationship coaching. 
Or you may prefer to focus on a few different things. For example: addressing both personal coaching and communication coaching.</p>
<p>We focus on one goal per session. You’re welcome to choose just one area, or several to work on over time. 
Whichever you feel is the most beneficial to you. This is also something we’ll assess during your Discovery Session.</p>
<p>Please be aware that Life Coaches are not clinical therapists or psychological counsellors. 
If you are seeking help for serious mental or emotional issues, you can find a 
list of therapists and counsellors in your area by clicking <a href="https://www.cpca-rpc.ca/counsellor-directory.aspx">here</a>.</p>

<li>We'll work together through mental and verbal exercises related to your goals.</li> 
<li>Each session ends with a simple, personalized assignment to help you take consistent action in moving forward.</li>
<li>You're expected to be proactive and accountable in all areas pertaining to your Coaching commitment.</li>

<h5>The rewards:</h5>
<p>The work we do in the course of your coaching sessions, will benefit you for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>Your communication skills, your ability to prioritize, your sense of self worth, your appreciation of others, 
your increased ability to feel positive and vital... These are just some of the permanent, profound changes. 
Choosing to benefit from Life Coaching means you have the wisdom and courage to become the very best of yourself.</p>
