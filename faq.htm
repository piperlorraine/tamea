<p class="large">Your pricing is all-inclusive, what does that mean and what's included?</p>
<p>I prefer to keep things simple and ethical.
Rather than charging you separately for each service, my pricing includes everything for one rate.
This means you'll only pay one straightforward amount for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your session or wedding coverage</li>
<li>Personalized, customizable services</li>
<li>Your images individually edited and retouched</li>
<li>Your photos provided to you in digital format</li>
</ul>
<p class="large">Will there be watermarks on my finished photos?</p>
<p>Nope, not one!</p>
<p class="large">Do you take passport photos?</p>
<p>Sorry, I don't. You can get passport photos taken at places like London Drugs for about $15.</p>
<p class="large">How would you describe the way you photograph people?</p>
<p>Tamea Burd Photography specializes in images that are natural, personal and sincere.
My sessions and wedding coverage are low-key and informal, with a focus on putting people at ease.</p>
<p>Whether it's weddings, portraits or headshots, my style is to capture people at their genuine, relaxed best.
I firmly believe that anyone and everyone can look great in a photo, as long as they feel happy and comfortable.</p>
<p class="large">How will I know what to wear and what to bring to my headshot or portrait photo-session?</p>
<p>Once you've booked your session, I'll send you a confirmation email with all the information you'll need to know about how to prepare.</p>
<p class="large">My session is on-location, how do I prepare my home or my workplace?</p>
<p>Chances are your location has several options for good backgrounds, good light, interesting details, etc.
It's knowing which to choose that can be tricky. You're not expected to figure that out on your own, I promise!</p>
<p>Once you've booked an on-location session, you'll receive an email from me with details about preparing and choosing your location.</p>
<p class="large">When do I get my photos?</p>
<p>Hiring a professional photographer means that once your session is done, there are still many more hours or days of work involved to
individually edit and retouch each image.</p>
<p>For all portrait sessions and headshot sessions, my standard delivery time is 10-15 days.<br />
For wedding photography, my standard delivery time is within 60-90 days.</p>
<p class="large">How is your business eco-friendly?</p>
<p>(In addition to hugging the occasional tree) I recycle and use recycled and sustainable materials. 
My supplies are bought locally to Vancouver whenever possible.
Most importantly, all photos are distributed exclusively in digital format.
This gives my clients the ability to choose and order their own prints, from anywhere and in whatever quantity they need.
(Not just better for the environment, better for your budget too!)</p>
<p class="large">I've found some other photographers with really cheap rates, why do you charge more?</p>
<p>The short answer is, as with most things in life, you get what you pay for... When you hire a photographer simply 
because they charge bargain prices, you'll get bargain quality photos. Which pretty much defeats the purpose of hiring a photographer at all.</p>
<p>My pricing is professional and competitive.
It's based on years of experience, high-grade equipment, personalized services and high-quality, individually edited images.</p>
<p>When you hire a professional photographer, it's important to remember that quality service costs more because it's worth more.</p>
