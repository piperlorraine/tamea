It is a rare gift in a photographer to think outside the box, or outside the studio, when shooting portraits. She finds out who you are, then sets out to capture that on camera. A good portrait is not just the technicalities of colour, and lighting. It conveys your personality, your feelings, your message. Youâ€™ll definitely get that and more with Tamea."
